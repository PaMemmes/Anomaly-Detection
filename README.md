# Anomaly-Detection

You can get the data from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html 

or from downloading only the relevant files from the compressed file from my google drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ciiKDR-3yqoLuzquwAcnvb8x_pNFRUAC/view?usp=sharing.

Extract the .csv files to the folder data/MachineLearningCVE

Then you can run preprocess.py to preprocess the files and run the models afterwards.
